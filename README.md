# LatexCreator
A small tool which creates a Latex-document with one file for each assignment, and connects them with the subfile-package.

## How to use it
 - Browse for a folder or enter a path to create the document in
 - Browse for a preamble or enter a path. Preamble must include the subfiles-package
 - Enter number of assignments
 - Hit _Create_
 
 LatexCreator will create a Latex-document with one file for each assignment, and a frontpage.
 You can compile each assignment separately, or the entire document at once.
